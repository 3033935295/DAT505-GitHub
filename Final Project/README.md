Final Project
There is a map of china in this project.And when you click on the map, the corresponding provincial GPD will be displayed. And you can rotate the geometry by your mouse.

### source of ideals
I think data visualization is better to emerge.At the same time, I see a example which is a map in the three.js.So I want to combine both of them.  

### structure

The folder "js" contains a folder named "img",two jsons named "china" and "chinaGDP".The folder contains two textures used in the project to perform the height of the GDP of each province.And the "china" is the coordinates of china's map.The "chinaGDP" is the data that GDP of each province.

### code

The GDP data is from the Official Website of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (http://www.stats.gov.cn/).And the map's data is from this web(https://download.csdn.net/download/xujialei1234/10390066).
