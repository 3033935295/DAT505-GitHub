## Final Project
### There is a map of china in this project.And when you click on the map, the corresponding provincial GPD will be displayed. And you can rotate the geometry by your mouse.

## source of ideals
### I think data visualization is better to emerge.At the same time, I see a example which is a map in the three.js.So I want to combine both of them.  

## structure

### The folder "js" contains a folder named "img",two jsons named "china" and "chinaGDP".The folder contains two textures used in the project to perform the height of the GDP of each province.And the "china" is the coordinates of china's map.The "chinaGDP" is the data that GDP of each province.

### The GDP data is from the Official Website of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (http://www.stats.gov.cn/).

### First, it introduced a database of GDP, and set the height of the geometry to be higher when the data number is higher. Create a geometry at the same time, and then add a texture(texture2).
